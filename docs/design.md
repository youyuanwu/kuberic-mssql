## Decision

Kuberic will treat SQL Server as an external replication engine. SQL Server
owns log transport, hardening, redo, and automatic seeding. Kuberic may
eventually own the distributed intent and reconciliation around those native
operations.

The first supported target is deliberately narrow:

| Area | Initial contract |
|---|---|
| Engine | SQL Server 2025, major version 17; older majors are rejected |
| Platform | Linux x86-64 containers, or native Ubuntu 24.04 with SQL Server 2025 CU1+ |
| Edition | Enterprise Developer for tests; Enterprise for a future production profile |
| Availability group | Full AG, one managed user database |
| AG naming | `EXTERNAL` limit of 64 characters, enforced as 64 UTF-16 code units |
| Cluster type | `EXTERNAL` |
| Topology | Three synchronous data replicas |
| Failover mode | `EXTERNAL` |
| Seeding | Automatic |
| Commit protection | `REQUIRED_SYNCHRONIZED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT = 1` |
| Write fencing | SQL Server external write lease plus a verified fence receipt |
| Default behavior | Observe only |

Images must be pinned by digest; native `mssql-server` packages must have an exact
build-revision version and a recorded archive SHA-256. `EngineArtifact` keeps
these provisioning profiles distinct; a native fixture does not invent an image
reference. Accepting the SQL Server EULA remains an explicit deployer action and
is never implied by the adapter. Native package installation, edition setup,
HADR/TLS configuration and credential provisioning remain external operations.
The runtime neither installs packages nor manages the host service.

SQL Server 2025 separates Enterprise Developer and Standard Developer editions.
Only the Enterprise-feature profile is accepted: EngineEdition 3 and an
Enterprise Developer or Enterprise display name. Standard Developer, Standard,
Express and Evaluation remain unsupported.

The AG name limit is narrower than the general `sysname` limit.
`CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP` documents 128 characters for `cluster_type = WSFC`
but 64 for `cluster_type = NONE` and `EXTERNAL`, and the engine enforces it as
error 19544. Before SQL Server 2022 CU23 an over-length name raised an assertion
failure rather than that error, so client-side rejection avoids a crash-class
failure on older builds. Microsoft states the bound in "characters" without
naming a unit; the adapter counts UTF-16 code units, which is never more
permissive than counting scalar values.

`CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE` is intentionally excluded. Microsoft documents it as a
read-scale configuration without high availability. It allows manual T-SQL
failover but has no cluster-manager arbitration, so using it would not
demonstrate the safe failover requested by youyuanwu/kuberic#80. Windows/WSFC,
Basic AGs,
distributed AGs, asynchronous disaster recovery, configuration-only replicas,
multiple managed databases, and mixed major versions are also out of scope for
the initial profile.

## Current Implementation

This repository implements the safety contract and a standalone observe-only
runtime:

- validation of the supported SQL Server profile;
- immutable container/native-package artifacts and Kubernetes Secret references;
- native AG, database, replica, and incarnation identities;
- separate desired replica identities for bootstrap, before SQL Server generates
  native replica GUIDs;
- exact SQL Server `numeric(25,0)` database progress values without narrowing
  them to Kuberic progress;
- a dedicated signed `ConfigurationSequence` and optional observe-only Kuberic
  adapter that publishes validated AG configuration authority as current
  progress;
- observations that distinguish present, absent, stale, and failed evidence;
- versioned operation envelopes with canonical SHA-256 input signatures;
- explicit destructive approvals and fence references;
- duplicate-operation and operation-ID-reuse classification;
- verified-TLS TDS execution with mounted observation credentials;
- capability-checked, identity-bracketed native DMV snapshots; and
- a freshness-aware monitor and observe-only JSON CLI.

The production crate connects to already provisioned SQL Server instances. It
does not create an AG, seed a database, renew a write lease, change a native
role, or integrate with either Kuberic operator. The optional Kuberic runtime
adapter validates role and progress callbacks without mutating SQL Server.
Mutation configuration is therefore only a contract for later stages, not an
enabled execution path.

The crate remained independent when the classic runtime was removed. The
`sqlserver-observer` binary
and runtime remain independently testable without the replication runtime.
See the [observe-only runtime guide](observation.md) for configuration,
permissions, output semantics, and tests.

Two capabilities named in this design are defined but not yet enforceable, and
each is assigned to a later stage rather than half-built now:

- **Encoding and decoding.** The canonical writer produces the bytes that the
  input signature covers, but there is no operation-envelope reader or `serde`
  support, so an envelope cannot yet be persisted or sent between processes.
  Stage 3 owns the decoder together with the durable result journal that needs
  it. Observation JSON serialization does not change the operation contract.
  `OperationRequest::from_decoded_parts` exists as the seam that decoder will
  use, and is the only path on which the contract-version check is reachable.
- **Proof validity and issuance.** `DestructiveApproval` and `FenceReference`
  currently bind a receipt to an exact operation ID and canonical input
  signature. They carry no issue or expiry time and no issuer verification, so
  the type system cannot yet express an expired or forged proof, and any caller
  able to construct an envelope can construct a receipt for it. Stage 4 owns
  receipt lifetime and issuer authentication, alongside the external lease
  handling that gives those fields their meaning. Until then, no code path may
  treat the presence of a receipt as evidence that fencing actually occurred.

## Why the PostgreSQL Adapter Is Not a Drop-in Template

The retired classic PostgreSQL adapter had a placeholder binary, in-memory
access flags and last-known scalar progress. Those limitations do not describe
the [implemented PostgreSQL v2 contract](https://github.com/youyuanwu/kuberic/blob/main/docs/features/postgres/design.md):
its executable
uses the v2 host, completed access fences drain the owned PostgreSQL process,
and recovery validates fresh, exact-session native lineage and replay evidence.
Workstream 4 is validated with host-local subprocesses; images, deployment and
distribution remain deferred, without PostgreSQL KinD coverage.

That control-plane/data-plane boundary is useful, but PostgreSQL's WAL,
timeline and process-fencing mechanisms are not SQL Server AG protocols.
PostgreSQL LSNs fit a 64-bit scalar; SQL Server DMV positions are
`numeric(25,0)` with field-specific meanings. SQL Server still needs its own
native identity, progress, lease and role evidence, rather than copying
PostgreSQL recovery or relying on generic scalar election ordering.

## Native HA Boundary

For `CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL`, normal failover belongs to the external cluster
manager. Kuberic must not issue an isolated `ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP ...
FAILOVER` and then infer success from an RPC response.

Microsoft publishes the `mssql-server-ha` resource-agent source specifically so
other clustering systems can follow the SQL Server protocol. Its AG helper:

- monitors the SQL Server instance and AG;
- reads native configuration sequence numbers;
- computes promotion eligibility;
- promotes and demotes through the external-cluster session contract; and
- maintains the external write lease.

The mutation implementation should invoke a pinned, tested helper build or
faithfully implement that published protocol. Reimplementing only its visible
T-SQL statements is not sufficient because sequence-number arbitration,
required synchronous secondaries, lease renewal, health thresholds, and action
ordering jointly establish safety.

The external write lease is the database-native write fence for direct TDS
clients. Kuberic may renew it only while the accepted primary still has valid
cluster authority. Before promotion, the planner must prove that the old
primary's lease expired or present a verified infrastructure fence that
prevents that exact incarnation from writing or restarting. A Service update,
readiness failure, Pod deletion request, Kubernetes Lease, or in-memory
`PartitionState` flag is not such proof.

## Observation Contract

An observation snapshot must retain provenance and freshness and must
distinguish:

- a catalog object that is absent;
- a replica that is unreachable;
- permission-denied or malformed output;
- a stale last-known observation; and
- an unsupported engine or protocol state.

Every observation records when the attempt was made, including failed attempts,
so that a caller can reason about how long evidence has been unavailable. A
failed observation is never fresh, and an observation stamped in the future is
also reported as not fresh: clock skew must degrade toward refusing to act, not
toward trusting an unverifiable sample.

The observer will read and cross-check at least:

- `SERVERPROPERTY(...)` and `@@SERVERNAME`;
- `sys.availability_groups`;
- `sys.availability_replicas`;
- `sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states`;
- `sys.availability_databases_cluster`;
- `sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states`;
- `sys.databases`; and
- automatic and physical seeding DMVs.

Replica and database rows are joined by their native GUIDs. Local observations
must not be confused with a primary's potentially stale report about a remote
replica. The AG identity and local role are sampled again around a multi-query
observation; a SQL transaction does not make the DMVs a globally atomic
snapshot.

SQL Server exposes multiple progress concepts. Hardened-block, redone-record,
and committed-record positions remain distinct exact decimal values. They
cannot be truncated into the former classic runtime's scalar `i64`, compared across
different databases, or compared across incompatible recovery histories.
Every progress-bearing transition therefore includes both the database GUID
and recovery-fork GUID.

## Command Contract

Each SQL Server operation is bound to:

- contract version;
- Kuberic resource identity;
- operation identity;
- source configuration identity;
- source and target epochs;
- native AG/database/replica identities;
- target Pod incarnation;
- database recovery lineage for progress-bearing transitions;
- all operation-specific safety inputs;
- destructive authorization, when required; and
- a verified fence reference, when required.

Canonical input encoding uses fixed field order, explicit variant and option
tags, big-endian integers, length-prefixed UTF-8 strings, and sorted set-like
collections. The input signature is SHA-256 over that encoding. It is an
idempotency and conflict-detection value, not authentication.

A second digest, the effect signature, covers the same encoding minus the
operation identity under a distinct domain-separation prefix. It answers a
different question: whether two requests ask SQL Server for the same thing. The
input signature cannot answer it, because the operation ID is part of the input
it covers.

Approval and fence receipts are evidence about a request, not request input.
Each carries the exact operation ID and canonical input signature that it
authorizes. They are excluded from that signature to avoid a circular encoding
and to permit replacement of an expired proof without changing the requested
database effect.

An exact duplicate returns the retained result. Reusing an operation ID with
different canonical input is rejected. A planner that crashes after dispatch but
before persisting its intent can regenerate the same native effect under a fresh
operation ID, so a request whose effect signature matches a retained result
under a different operation ID is reported distinctly and requires reobserving
the native postcondition. A lost response is resolved the same way; it is not
permission to issue a conflicting operation.

The initial operation vocabulary is:

- `EnsureAvailabilityGroup`;
- `EnsureReplicaJoined`;
- `EnsureReplicaSeeded`;
- `ReseedReplica`;
- `PlannedSwitchover`; and
- `ForcedFailover`.

Reseeding and forced failover require operation-bound destructive approval.
Reseeding additionally fences the target being replaced. Both switchover and
failover fence the exact old-primary incarnation.

## Security Contract

There are three separate trust boundaries:

1. TDS administration with verified TLS and separate observation and mutation
   principals.
2. AG endpoint encryption and certificate authentication between replicas.
3. Authenticated command authority between the future operator and replica
   agent.

Only Kubernetes Secret references belong in desired state. Passwords,
certificate private keys, connection strings containing credentials, and SQL
batches containing secrets must not be stored in CRD status, operation
signatures, logs, or command-line arguments. Observation permissions and
mutation permissions must use distinct Secret keys. SQL Server 2025 observation
permissions, including `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE`, must be validated
explicitly; metadata hidden by insufficient permission must not be treated as
absence.

Endpoint certificates, system databases, and user data all require durable
storage and explicit rotation procedures. Availability Groups do not replicate
server logins or other server-level objects, so those need separate
provisioning.

## Level-Triggered Integration Boundary

youyuanwu/kuberic#79 supplied the durable level-triggered runtime and controller
boundary. This repository now consumes the published runtime for an observe-only
progress vertical slice. Controller deployment and authority-changing SQL
operations still require:

- durable replica and incarnation evidence;
- versioned declarative commands and retained terminal results;
- normalized observation and typed proof transport;
- compact accepted topology and transition intent;
- a pure planner that emits at most one authority-changing command; and
- separate persistence and dispatch reconciliation cycles.

The current SQL Server code remains an independently testable adapter library
and laboratory tool. It does not claim automatic Kubernetes failover.

## Delivery Sequence

1. **Support and safety contract** — implemented: types, validation,
   canonical operation identity, tests, and this design.
2. **Runtime and observation** — implemented: a replaceable TDS executor,
   immutable DMV snapshots, freshness, startup capability checks, an
   observe-only CLI, and Kuberic configuration-progress publication.
3. **Bootstrap, join, and reseed** — pure convergence decisions, one native
   effect at a time, durable SQL-specific result journal, and automatic-seeding
   postconditions.
4. **Switchover, failover, and fencing** — external lease handling, sequence
   arbitration, verified fence receipts, explicit data-loss recovery, and live
   fault tests. Automatic failover remains disabled until every safety gate
   passes.
5. **Controller integration** — Pod/PVC/Secret/Service convergence through the
   implemented Kuberic command/evidence boundary.
6. **Kubernetes E2E and operations** — pinned licensed test environment,
   three-replica failures, process/operator restarts, client reconnection,
   upgrades, and runbooks.

Stages 1-4 do not require operator2. Stages 5-6 require the minimum
youyuanwu/kuberic#79 vertical slice, but do not need to wait for every
youyuanwu/kuberic#79 operation to be complete.

## Test Gates

Server-free tests
cover profile rejection, exact progress, malformed observations, canonical
operation vectors, duplicate/reused operation IDs, epoch regression,
destructive approval, and fence binding. They run in the ordinary CI job as
`cargo test --all-features`.
Runtime tests also cover typed DMV decoding, inconsistent snapshots,
permissions, transport and sample deadlines, freshness, cancellation, CLI
output, and credential redaction. A dedicated server-free observer workflow
runs these without provisioning PostgreSQL or Kubernetes.

Live tests run in the shared validation job alongside server-free checks.
The job runs on PRs, main-branch pushes and manual dispatches, with automatic
EULA acceptance for one digest-pinned SQL Server 2025 Enterprise Developer
container fixture for absence, a metadata-only present AG, Kuberic progress,
denied permissions, invalid TLS and CLI output validation. Shared
`just ci`/`provision`/`validate-live`/`cleanup`
commands own image verification, container creation, HADR/TLS/principal setup
and cleanup outside the observer. Tests and CLI remain host processes. The helper
refuses unrelated or modified containers. The fixture helper creates and owns
one metadata-only AG with three configured replicas, no database and no
mirroring endpoint. Production runtime code creates no AG. This does not enable
runtime mutation or validate HA. The same ensure-ready operation is used locally:
it preserves an already-running exact fixture, starts/stops a verified stopped
container, or creates/removes an absent one. A private ownership record lets
cleanup distinguish borrowed, started and newly created containers. Lifecycle checks are
test-environment safeguards, not production fencing attestation.
That job must pin the engine image, tools, and helper
artifacts; accept the EULA explicitly; isolate credentials; and fail rather
than skip when requested prerequisites are missing. Mutation support cannot be
declared complete until live tests cover crash points before and after intent
persistence, native dispatch, postcondition observation, result persistence,
reply, and routing publication.
